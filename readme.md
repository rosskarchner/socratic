A Python Client for Socrata
======================

Socrata-python is dead (or, at least "deprecated"). Long live socratic.

Thanks to Aiden Scandella and Socrata for getting it this far!

This library provides an interface to the [SODA][] Publisher API. If you're new to all this, you may want to brush up on the [getting started][] guide.

If you're curious about how things work under the hood, you can also browse the [API documentation][] directly.
